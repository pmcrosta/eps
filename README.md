## Student Enrollment Patterns and Graphics

### Overview
This repository contains the R code used to produce the [Community College Research Center](http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/) reports entitled:
* [Intensity and Attachment: How the Chaotic Enrollment Patterns of Community College Students Affect Educational Outcomes](http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/intensity-and-attachment-educational-outcomes.html)
* [Characteristics of Early Community College Dropouts](http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/early-community-college-dropouts.html)
* [Trends in Enrollment Patterns Among Community College Students](http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/trends-in-enrollment-patterns.html)

### Shiny+R
The repository also contains the R/Shiny files for an interactive web application that allows users to create enrollment pattern graphics on demand for various subgroups. The Shiny site is meant to be a companion to the paper; it uses a more expansive database and allows individuals to further explore issues discussed in the papers. This application has been hosted at http://chagall.tc.columbia.edu/shiny/eps/. However, this is not a production server and thus there is no guarantee of availability.

### Intensity and Attachment Paper Abstract
This paper examines the relationship between community college enrollment patterns and two successful student outcomesâ€”credential completion and transfer to a four-year institution. It also introduces a new way of visualizing the various attendance patterns of community college students. Patterns of enrollment intensity (full-time or part-time status) and continuity (enrolling in consecutive terms or skipping one or more terms) are graphed and then clustered according to their salient features.

Using data on cohorts of first-time community college students at five colleges in a single state, the author finds that, over an 18-semester period, 10 patterns of attendance account for nearly half the students. Among the remaining students who persisted, there is astounding variation in their patterns of enrollment. Clustering these patterns reveals two relationships: the first is a positive association between enrollment continuity and earning a community college credential, and the second is a positive association between enrollment intensity and likelihood of transfer.
